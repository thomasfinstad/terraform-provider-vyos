## Description

Configure VyOS Rolling Release via terraform, the LTS version was planned and later canceled after it became harder for me to spin it up and test it.

This provider is autogenerated from the api schema definitions, this places some limitations on what is feasible to do. As such some fields that should have validation or be set as required are not marked as such, if the returned error message does not indicate what the issue is the fastest way to figure it out is usually to ssh into your VyOS instance and set the values matching your terraform config and view the error message as the API does not always return the full message.
