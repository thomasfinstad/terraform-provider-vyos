    |  &lt;number&gt;%%    &emsp;|  Percentage of interface link speed  |
- `description` (String) Description

    |  Format  &emsp;|  Description  |
    |----------------|---------------|
    |  txt     &emsp;|  Description  |
- `flow_isolation` (Attributes) Flow isolation settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--flow_isolation))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource ID, full vyos path to the resource with each field seperated by dunder (`__`).

<a id="nestedatt--flow_isolation"></a>
### Nested Schema for `flow_isolation`

Optional:

- `blind` (Boolean) Disables flow isolation, all traffic passes through a single queue
- `dst_host` (Boolean) Flows are defined only by destination address
- `dual_dst_host` (Boolean) Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, fairness is applied first over destination addresses, then over individual flows
- `dual_src_host` (Boolean) Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, fairness is applied first over source addresses, then over individual flows
- `flow` (Boolean) Flows are defined by the entire 5-tuple
- `host` (Boolean) Flows are defined by source-destination host pairs
- `nat` (Boolean) Perform NAT lookup before applying flow-isolation rules
- `src_host` (Boolean) Flows are defined only by source address
- `triple_isolate` (Boolean) Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, fairness is applied over source and destination addresses and also over individual flows (default)
